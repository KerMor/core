/** 
@defgroup sampling Parameter sampling
  This module is concerned with sampling a system's parameter domain @f$P@f$

@defgroup s_grid Regular grid sampling
 Samples from the parameter domain @f$P@f$ are taken creating a regular grid.
 @sa s_rand
 @ingroup sampling

@defgroup s_rand Random parameter sampling
 Samples from the parameter domain @f$P@f$ are taken using random vectors.
 @sa s_grid
 @ingroup sampling

@defgroup general General functions and algorithms
 This Module contains general functions that can be used independently of the KerMor framework.

@defgroup interpolation Kernel Interpolation functions
	Kernel-based function interpolation
	@ingroup general
	@sa general

@defgroup snapshot Snapshot generation
@defgroup reduction Reduced Space Computations
