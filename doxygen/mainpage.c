 * @mainpage KerMor software
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * KerMor is a MATLAB&copy; library providing routines for model order reduction
 * of dynamical systems using Kernels.
 * The overall structure is
 *
 * -# @ref sampling "Sampling" of parameter domains
 *  - Grid sampling,
 *  - Random sampling
 * -# @ref snapshot "Snapshot generation"
 * -# @ref reduction "Reduced subspace computation"
 *   - @ref pod "POD methods"
 * -# @ref models "Implementations of models"
 *   - @ref pcd "Programmed Cell Death"
 * -# @ref testing "Testing of KerMor components"
 *

 *
 * @section learning How To get started with KerMor
 *
 * - Obtain a copy via git using
 * @verbatim git clone /agh/git/kermor <somelocalfolder>@endverbatim
 * - Check out the @ref testing and @ref models sections.
@section a ToDo's for DoxyGen-parser
@todo Adding folder to glob should also add all top-level functions with @@ingroup "name" to that module (adds a method summary)
@todo The file list for each module should contain the full relative path within the project (subfolder/mfilename) 
@todo allow detection of nested field parameters , i.e. if a param "model" is given, a reference to model.field1.subfield should be detected and "field1.subfield" be added to the required fields list.
@todo luxus-version: if a field of the param "model" is used like "varname = model.structfield" any statement like "varname.field1" should result in a new entry "model.structfield.field1" in the required fields list (recursively)
@todo if subroutines refer to a fcn param in the outer function's context, the call to any used field should be registered,too and the field added to the "required" list
@todo check function parsing as some functions appear twice in functions list
