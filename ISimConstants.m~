        % leave implementation body empty otherwise.

        % It is arguable if it should be preferred to implement an empty
        % method body here instead of forcing subclasses to explicitly
        % implement this method. Of course it would be more convenient but
        % having it abstract forces any implementers TO GET KNOWLEDGE about
        % this functionality and thus prevents them from trying workarounds
        % for the very same problem.
